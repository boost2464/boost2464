# Hi, I’m @boost2464


- 👀 I’m interested in Networking and System Administration and a believer in FOSS and OSS.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning on the Odin Project, CS50x and few other bits and pieces.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I have the required knowledge or can at least be taught enough to help rather than hinder

- 📫 How to reach me....
